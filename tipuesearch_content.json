I have been using VIM for last couple of years to do the basic editing and was happy with whatever I learn about using vim in the process. Deep within I always wanted to become a better user of vim, tried different experimentation which includes installing mindless plugins, copying from different vimrc files sometimes understanding and sometime not understanding the concepts. Moral of the story is nothing sticked to my brain or what we call muscle memory to use it efficiently. Fortunately enough when I was struggling with the idea to become better at vim, this article How To Learn Vim: A Four Week Plan came along and I was immediately interested, clubbed this with the 100daysofx and I had a plan at becoming better at VIM.

FileHeader to Write Meta-Data in Sublime Text Sublime Text is a very nice Text editor for writing Markdown. There are already a lot of articles on how to configure Sublime text for Markdown. We will discuss about one specific package in Sublime Text called FileHeader , this package helps in writing custom File Header, so we can use this package to provide some Meta-Data to the pelican blog by default.

Clean the Output Directory We are working with two git repositories when writing a pelican blog. root This is the folder which has the content and all the setting file. output This is the actual HTML page generated by Pelican. Most often than not we might want to generate the complete blog with a clean build with commands like this. pelican content -ds publishconf.py # While Publishing pelican content -d # Local host. The problem with these above commands is they might delete the .git or even the CNAME directory inside output losing the link with version control. We can prevent this by adding this configuration into our pelicanconf.py OUTPUT_RETENTION = [ \".hg\" , \".git\" , \"CNAME\" ] This change will make sure that the above mentioned file are not deleted. Kindly keep in mind this works for only the above 2 version of the command, if you use make clean then this configuration is of no use.

Google Analytics provide us with very valuable insights into how a user interacts with the website, like the links which users click the most etc. This is a free service which really helps when we are starting out. When we create an account with Google Analytics , we receive a tracking code which we need to provide to Pelican blog. This tracking code is generally of the form UA-********-* , which you can find in this menu flow Administration ---> Property Settings ---> Tracking Id , copy this tracking id and provide it to publishconf.py with this settings GOOGLE_ANALYTICS = \"UA-********-*\" This is it, we will get all the analytics data from our website on Google Analytics. DISQUS DISQUS is a commenting system which is used extensively in the pelican blog world as we have to engage with our visitors for providing feedback and anything which is deemed important to the visitors. Integrating Disqus with any blog requires a ShortName , which is a unique identifier for our site, which can be found in this path https://<username>.disqus.com/admin/settings/general/ . We need to add this setting into the publishconf.py . DISQUS_SITENAME = \"shortName\" The Elegant Theme provides a nice feature called Collapsible Comments in which we will not show all the comments when the page loads. This comments will only be shown when a user presses the comment link. We can use a COMMENTS_INTRO settings to draw the user for engaging with the site. MailChimp MailChimp is a way to provide newsletters to your active subscribers, in this way they can be informed for any new post also immediately. Mailchimp can also be used as an email marketing platform. This is also free for basic subscription. We will need a MAILCHIMP_FORM_ACTION , URL which we can get by creating one list in MailChimp.

I am listing these changes here, if this are still unresolved in the future. Elegant , requires a lot of different plugins to make it work the way it was designed. If you see the documentation on the above link, it does not mention the important plugins which are required to make it work, it just provides an explanation on the feature. In this blog post I am listing down the issues which I faced while integrating the Elegant themes. favicon.ico not displayed with Elegant If you read the documentation on how to enable favicon.ico for Elegant themes, the process is pretty straight forward, just place the icons into this directory content/theme/images , and define STATIC_PATHS with STATIC_PATHS = ['theme/images', 'images'] . If you follow the above process then most probably you will still not be getting the favicon.ico , the reason being there is one more configuration which needs to enabled in pelicanconf.py in addition to above two. STATIC_PATHS = [ 'theme/images' , 'images' ] USE_SHORTCUT_ICONS = True The reason for this is, the links for including favicon are generated in this template themes/elegant/templates/_includes/favicon_links.html , and the link generation is under a configuration named USE_SHORTCUT_ICONS , so until we make it True the links will not be generated. Issues while integrating Tipue Search Prerequisite Tipue Search plugin integration is little different from other plugin. This plugin has an external dependency on BeautifulSoup , we have to install this python package first in our environment pelican1 pip install beautifulsoup4 We have to add this plugin name into pelicanconf.py PLUGINS = [ 'sitemap' , 'tipue_search' ] When we build our blog after this we should see our search functionality working, but we see 2 issues. Search Result are not displayed. Tipue search return undefined URL. Search Result are not displayed Elegant uses some predefined HTML pages to render few of its content, search functionality is based on one such file, so we have to provide that in the pelicanconf.py DIRECT_TEMPLATES = (( 'index' , 'tags' , 'categories' , 'archives' , 'search' , '404' )) When we do this changes we will see the search result getting listed, but on clicking those link it will redirect to an undefined URL. Tipue search return undefined URL. When we click on the Search result, we get the URL as undefined, this issues is still not solved, there is already a pull request pending on the Github. Kindly visit these two links for more details. Tipue search return undefined url . To solve the issue, we have to modify the plugin manually as mentioned in the pull request - Change the file in plugins/tipue_search/tipue_search.py , line no 61 add this code 'loc': page_url TOC Integration with Elegant Elegant theme has a side bar with the Table of Content of the blog post displayed. This is also achieved based on a plugin named extract_toc . We have to add this into the pelicanconf.py PLUGINS = [ 'sitemap' , 'tipue_search' , 'extract_toc' ] There is also a Markdown settings which we have to update in the same file like this. MARKDOWN = { 'extension_configs' : { 'markdown.extensions.toc' :{ 'permalink' : 'true' } } } In addition to the above changes, every blog post after the file meta-data section should have an entry named [TOC] Syntax Highlighting When writing a technical blog we might be interested in syntax highlighting of the code we write, we can achieve this with following configuration in pelicanconf.py MARKDOWN = { 'extension_configs' : { 'markdown.extensions.codehilite' : { 'css_class' : 'highlight' }, 'markdown.extensions.extra' : {}, 'markdown.extensions.meta' : {}, 'markdown.extensions.toc' :{ 'permalink' : 'true' }, }, 'output_format' : 'html5' , } Next and Previous Articles. When we read the documentation of Elegant Next and Previous Articles , it clearly states that we do not require any additional plugins for this feature, but it does not work out of the box. We have to integrate the neighbors plugins and then it works. Now we will have these in our pelicanconf.py PLUGINS = [ 'sitemap' , 'tipue_search' , 'extract_toc' , 'neighbors' ] Missing icons for social links Pelican supports a way to integrate most of the social Website like Twitter , Facebook , Github etc. This is done by the help of this settings in pelicanconf.py SOCIAL = (( 'github' , 'URL to your profile' ), ( 'linkedin-square' , 'URL to your profile' ), ( 'facebook' , 'URL to your profile' ), ( 'quora' , 'URL to your profile' ), ( 'reddit' , 'URL to your profile' ), ( 'twitter' , 'URL to your profile' ) ) This explains that we have a tuple of tuple in the settings name SOCIAL , if you see each website name is in a particular format, as explained in this link , this format is taken from Font Awesome icon for social links .

We will first focus on how we can integrate one particular themes and also one particular plugins which will give us a fair amount of idea on how to integrate different plugins. Integrating the Elegant Theme We have already created folder named plugins and themes , which are clone of the Pelican Plugins and Themes repository. If we see the directory listing inside themes folder we fill find different folders with distinguished names, these are the themes name. To use any of the themes in this folder we have to add this pelican settings in the pelicanconf.py . THEME = 'themes/elegant' Follow the commands to generate the site and launch the site, and you have your new themes applied. pelican content cd output/ python -m pelican.server Integrating A Plugin into Pelican The process to integrate any plugin is also similar to integrating Themes. If we see inside the plugins directory which we had cloned, we will find a lot of different folder name just like in themes directory. Each of these name is a plugin name. To integrate a plugin into Pelican we have to add these 2 configuration into the pelicanconf.py file. PLUGIN_PATHS = [ 'plugin' ] # Name of the directory where plugin are kept. PLUGINS = [ 'sitemap' ] # Name of the particular plugin inside the directory. In the above code sample, we can see we have integrated the sitemap plugin, and as per the documentation , this generates a Sitemap which we generally submit it to some Webmaster tools.

I would say first decide on Themes and the see what all plugins are required to support these themes. All plugins are not plug able with all the themes. We have to first start by choosing the themes, and the corresponding plugin required for it. This path is again the easiest as we are already treading the known, when we are comfortable with this integration we can always go ahead and enhance the existing themes and plugins to suit our needs. Till we reach the Jedi stage this precooked solution is the best approach. Flex Vs Elegant vs BootStrap3 When we are deciding on which themes to choose for the blog, broadly the working choice would be Flex: Responsive Pelican theme Elegant Why it is the best Pelican theme BootStrap3 There are many others, which you are free to explore, but for my blog I had considered these 3 options. Each one has its own pros and cons, the choice was very difficult between these 3, and in future I might even consider jumping ships to the other themes. Let's discuss some outline of the above 3 themes Flex: Responsive Pelican theme This has out of the box integration with a lot of plugins including AddThis , which is not available for any other themes. This also has support for Google AdSense, which again is missing in most of the plugin. Actively maintained, the last check-in on its Github repository was on Apr 24, 2017. Tipue_Search is also on the way, there is an open issue on the repository, Search #49 This facility of search is the only reason I dropped Flex . BootStrap3 This is a full hack able implementation of BootStrap3, and will try to use these Themes, once I get my hand dirty enough with the modern CSS and Web Technologies. Elegant Why it is the best Pelican theme I chose this theme just for its minimalist design and search feature. It has an integration with MailChimp. This is not an actively managed project, the last commit on this repository was on Sep 8, 2014, which is good 3 years ago. We can use and modify this theme for our satisfaction if a bug is hampering our development. We have decided on our Themes, the Plugins required for these themes are as below. sitemap tipue_search extract_toc neighbors The standard features and enhancements already available Disqus Google Analytics MailChimp Integration.

The process to link a Godaddy Domain to Github Pages can be divided into 2 Steps. Configure your Github repository Configure the DNS at GoDaddy Configure Github Repository We have already made a Github Pages website in our previous post, kindly follow the steps mentioned here . Once we have a Github Pages URL, we have to configure a CNAME in this repository, this can be done in 2 ways. Local Repository Directly on Github. Local Repository Create a local file in the repository with the name CNAME. Just have one line in the file. example.com , where example.com is your domain you have bought from GoDaddy . Push the changes to Github Directly on Github Pages. On the repository in Github , you will see something like this. In the above Click on the Settings , Scroll down you will see something like this. Enter the domain you have purchased from GoDaddy . These are the only changes required to be done in GitHub. Configure the DNS at GoDaddy The easiest of the all the below references is Configuring a Godaddy domain name with github pages . The real issue in all the links is that it shows the old UI of GoDaddy , so some things get confusing. Go to the account setting page, which mostly will like in this link . The link will look like this. Click on the + Symbols in Front of Domain, and Click on the Manage DNS Link The link will show a lot of Records , go to the end of the Records , and click on the link ADD From the above option we have to add 3 entries. This is how all the 3 would look like after adding. Now you can launch and check your desired domain.

One repository is for the source, which is our blog content. Second repository is for the generated files in the output folder. Prerequisite We all should have a GitHub account, if you have then continue, else go to GitHub and create an account. The process is very straight forward, just follow the instruction on the website. The git should be locally configured. Kindly follow the steps mention in this page Setting your email in Git . The first Repository We should now create our first Repository onto github. Click on the + icon which shows this drop down. And click on the option New Repository as shown above. This will open up a page with looks like this Fill in the repository name which you want to name, and write a little Description also do not click on the check-box which read Initialize this repository with a README Since we already have a folder in our local system, to check-in we can leave this box unchecked.

This is the symbol of empty repository which is created and now we can push our local code to this folder. Push code from local to Github repository We can follow the instruction mentioned above to push our local code to github, but we have to make sure that we do not push the output directory in the same repository as the code, because the handling of output directory is different. Go to the root of the folder, where your blog is kept. cd ~/mySampleBlog/ Go to the root of the directory where the blog post are kept git init This command initializes an empty repository in the same folder. Create a file named .gitignore in the same folder. Copy the below content to the .gitignore file. *~ ._* *.lock *.DS_Store *.swp *.out *.py [ cod ] output The above code basically prevents all the local temporary files and the output directory to be checked in. git status This command will make sure that the output folder is not tracked by git, check the output as shown below. On branch master Initial commit Untracked files: ( use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed ) .gitignore Makefile content/ fabfile.py pelicanconf.py publishconf.py nothing added to commit but untracked files present ( use \"git add\" to track ) Only files listed above will be tracked, and output directory is not one of them. git add . Adds all the above files to be ready for commit. git commit -m \"first commit\" This will make a commit locally with the commit message as first commit git remote add origin https://github.com/pelicanBlog/mySampleBlog.git This commands connects the remote repository of github with our local code. The URL might be different for you. git push -u origin master This will push the local changes to the GitHub repository we created. It will ask for your username and password, kindly provide those and we have pushed our code to github. Pushing the output folder The output folder is out actual blog, so this is a little different from the previous way of pushing code to github. Please follow along to create this special repository. Select the same New Repository from the + icon shown in previous repository. In the New Repository form, the magic happens with the Repository Name field, fill in the name as username.github.io , where username is your github username. Fill In the description. Now there are two ways to push the output folder to this new repository, you can follow any one of them. Push the output folder as a repository which we already know. git init git add . git commit -m \"first commit\" git remote add origin https://github.com/pelicanBlog/pelicanBlog.github.io.git git push -u origin master After the above command, just launch this URL in your browser, https://username.github.io/ , just change username with your username. Since the original source folder we create with output directory mentioned in .gitignore , we can now add this repository as a submodule in that repository, to provide a link between both the source and the output Go to the root of the blog content, in this case cd ~/mySampleBlog git submodule add -f https://github.com/pelicanBlog/pelicanBlog.github.io.git output This adds the output folder as a submodule. git commit -m \"added submodule\" git push -u origin master The above will make the output as a submodule With this we have completed our part of the blog series.

Pelican comes with two settings files to separate these 2 process. These two files are. pelicanconf.py publishconf.py Let's check what is the use of these 2 files, and how to manipulate these files to get the most out of pelican. These setting files are mostly passed to the templates associated with the themes to generate the site, all these settings are some parameters to these templates. pelicanconf.py We had used the pelican-quickstart to generate this blog, when we use this command, we get a pre-configured pelicanconf.py and a publishconf.py files. This have the bare basic configuration to be used based on the questions we answered on the options. These files basically contains the setting's identifier for the pelican blog, all the setting identifiers are in all-caps, and the values numbers (5, 20, etc.), Boolean (True, False, None, etc.), dictionaries, or tuples should not be enclosed in quotation marks. pelicanconf.py is used to generate the site locally and tested over localhost:8000 . The basic pelicanconf.py would look like this. #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- # from __future__ import unicode_literals AUTHOR = u 'Animesh' SITENAME = u 'Hello World' SITEURL = '' PATH = 'content' TIMEZONE = 'Asia/Kolkata' DEFAULT_LANG = u 'en' # Feed generation is usually not desired when developing FEED_ALL_ATOM = None CATEGORY_FEED_ATOM = None TRANSLATION_FEED_ATOM = None AUTHOR_FEED_ATOM = None AUTHOR_FEED_RSS = None ARTICLE_PATHS = [ 'articles' ,] ARTICLE_URL = 'articles/{slug}.html' ARTICLE_SAVE_AS = 'articles/{slug}.html' # Blogroll LINKS = (( 'Pelican' , 'http://getpelican.com/' ), ( 'Python.org' , 'http://python.org/' ), ( 'Jinja2' , 'http://jinja.pocoo.org/' ), ( 'You can modify those links in your config file' , '#' ),) # Social widget SOCIAL = (( 'You can add links in your config file' , '#' ), ( 'Another social link' , '#' ),) DEFAULT_PAGINATION = 10 # Uncomment following line if you want document-relative URLs when developing #RELATIVE_URLS = True If you remember correctly some of the settings value we had provided during the pelican-quickstart commands, like AUTHOR This is the name of the site author which we had entered during the questions asked. SITENAME This is the Name of the site which we provided. SITEURL Since we still do not have domain name registered, we had kept this empty, and also it makes sense to keep this empty for localhost testing. PATH content where we write our blog is the default path set. TIMEZONE This we had entered during the initial process, and in future if we want to change this we can change these settings. DEFAULT_LANG This was also entered during the pelican-quickstart process. FEEDS_* All the FEEDS_* related settings are empty because we have still not configured the RSS feeds settings, this we will change in the future. ARTICLE_* This is the settings which we modified for keeping the path of the post into one folder. LINKS This is a tuple of tuple, with each entry showing a link which you want provide in your blog. SOCIAL This is also a tuple of tuple, where each entry is meant to point to a name of a social network say Facebook and the link to your profile. DEFAULT_PAGINATION This is a number showing how many blogs should be listed on the front page. Some Themes use this setting for some other purposes. Now these settings are not fully exhaustive, Pelican has a huge list of setting, which we will revisit once we have the need of them. publishconf.py Unlike pelicanconf.py , this setting file is only used when we are supposed to publish our blog to the domain hosting. This configuration is accessed when we generate the site using the following commands. pelican content -s publishconf.py The basic content of these files look like this. #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- # from __future__ import unicode_literals # This file is only used if you use `make publish` or # explicitly specify it as your config file. import os import sys sys . path . append ( os . curdir ) from pelicanconf import * SITEURL = '' RELATIVE_URLS = False FEED_ALL_ATOM = 'feeds/all.atom.xml' CATEGORY_FEED_ATOM = 'feeds/ %s .atom.xml' DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = True # Following items are often useful when publishing #DISQUS_SITENAME = \"\" #GOOGLE_ANALYTICS = \"\" This file, basically build on top of the pelicanconf.py , as we can see from this line, from pelicanconf import * . What this means is all the configuration from pelicancongf.py is taken into consideration along with some specific configuration which is required for just publishing. If you see this setting most of them are empty which we will fill one by one as we make progress in our blog, but from the structure you might get an idea that this file pertains to its integration with the DISQUS comment system, and the GOOGLE_ANALYTICS code.

I prefer the sub folder approach as we can derive the category name just from the folder name. So go ahead for beginning create a folder inside content name articles cd content/ mkdir articles Now create your second post inside this and publish the content based on the command we learned on the previous post. Now if you launch the localhost:8000 , and click on the article title, you will see no difference but if you see on the URL bar, we still see that our post is without the article folder structure. We did not want this. Have a look In order to get the proper URL in the address bar we have to change somethings in the pelicanconf.py , we will explain what is the purpose of this file in a short file for not just add these 3 line into that config. ARTICLE_PATHS = [ 'articles' ,] ARTICLE_URL = 'articles/{slug}.html' ARTICLE_SAVE_AS = 'articles/{slug}.html' With is configuration in the config folder, just generate the blog with the commands already learned and then check the localhost:8000 . It should look like this. Now we have a proper folder structure. Static Pages Most often than not we will want some pages which will rarely change, like an About and a Contact pages. These type of static pages is also supported in the pelican blog. Just create a folder named pages inside content folder like this. cd content/ mkdir pages Now we are ready to make our sample About.md and Contact.md inside pages directory. Title: About Date: 2017-04-14 22:30 Modified: 2017-04-14 22:30 Slug: About Author: username Summary: This is a sample blog. The About Page for the blog. and Contact.md Title: Contact Date: 2017-04-14 22:30 Modified: 2017-04-14 22:30 Slug: Contact Author: username Summary: This is a sample blog contact page. The Contact Page for the blog. We again generate the blog and check it on localhost:8000 . When we see the output of pelican content command we will see this. Done: Processed 1 article, 0 drafts, 2 pages and 0 hidden pages in 0 .20 seconds. Which means that, the pages are generated. When we launch the localhost:8000 . we will see that the About and Contact menu like this We can modify these pages with the information which you want to furnish. Static Images Most often than not we will use images to link in our blogs, we can store all these images inside the content folder, having a directory called images . Do this by following these commands. cd content/ mkdir images Now we can copy any image inside this folder and try to link it into one of our blog. Just copy any image in this folder and copy the file name. Now create a link to this file inside the already existing blog post by the help of link of markdown, here is a sample. ![ Hello World 1 ]( {filename}../../images/helloWorldPelicanPost.png \"Hello World 2\" ) We should understand some details about the above piece of code. Hello World 1 The alt text is good if there is a browser which block image, this alt text is displayed, showing an information about what this images were supposed to do. \"Hello World 2\" This is the title of the image, which is shown as a tool tip once we hover over the image. {filename} This is a special syntax which is used by pelican to generate links, so be it URL or images, when using relative URLs kindly use this format. We have covered most of the folder structure inside article we will see the configuration files in the next blog post.

Pelican provides a great command pelican-quickstart , which asks a few questions to you and makes a boilerplate blog ready in a few seconds. We will go through the entire process explaining each option is details. Activate Python environment We had set up a separate python anaconda environment in our previous post now is the time to active the environment, we can do that by using a simple command. source activate pelican1 It will activate the pelican1 environment, and we can identify it by check the terminal prompt which will change to (pelican1) . Once the work is done, we can deactivate the same with a simple command. source deactivate pelican1 All the above command will work for Linux and Mac, kindly check the windows equivalent of the same. pelican-quickstart Now we are ready to divulge in the world of pelican. Pelican has a ready to bake command to set up the basic boilerplate for the blog. The command is called Before executing the below commands, just create a directory where you want your blog files to be stored. mkdir ~/myBlogDirectory cd ~/myBlogDirectory pelican-quickstart Just execute this commands and it asks you these series of questions, which we will talk in details. pelican-quickstart options The options shown after executing the pelican-quickstart are as below. We will discuss each and every option and their usage, we can always choose the default shown in capital letter, {Y|n} . Where do you want to create your new Website ? [.] Most probably we will keep the default as we are already in that directory, if not you can specify the path /home/pathtomyblog What will be the title of the blog? Provide a suitable title to your blog, do not worry even if you want to change it latter we can change it. Who will be the author of this Website ? Just provide any name you want whose name should be present as an author on the blog post, it can be your name as well. What will be the default language of this Website ? [en] The default choice is English , else you can give any language format mentioned in ISO 639-1 Language Codes, the list can be found ISO Language codes Do you want to specify a URL prefix? e.g., http://example.com (Y/n) If you already have purchased a domain give the domain name as shown in the example, else continue with n , we can later fill the domain name. Do you want to enable article pagination? (Y/n) We can go with the default of having pagination, which means how many posts of the blogs will be displayed in one page, the choice of this is in the next question. How many articles per page do you want? [10] The default choice is 10 , for the time being keep it that way. What is your time zone? [Europe/Paris] To change the time zone, we should be aware that these are tz database time zone, to exactly get the time zone codes for your country visit List of tz database time zones , give the code without the [] . Do you want to generate a Fabfile/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) There are multiple ways to automate the blog publishing process, makefile and fabic comes to our help, just chose the default and we will decide on this later. This creates two files in the directory, fabfile.py and Makefile Do you want an auto-reload & simpleHTTP script to assist with theme and site development? (Y/n) We have the help of auto-reload commands to automatically generates the preview as soon as we change anything in the themes, we might not require it initially, so keep it false. Do you want to upload your website using FTP? (y/N) If we had an FTP site where we could upload, just choose the default and say n Do you want to upload your website using SSH? (y/N) If you are hosting uses SSH, for our use case we will choose N , which is the default. Do you want to upload your website using Dropbox? (y/N) We can also use Dropbox to upload our static files, but for this, we will try some other time, for now choose the default which is N . Do you want to upload your website using S3? (y/N) We also have the facility of choosing amazon S3 for our site hosting, for now not needed chose N Do you want to upload your website using Rackspace Cloud Files? (y/N) Again the default N , we are not using Rackspace. Do you want to upload your website using GitHub Pages? (y/N) We can choose y here, but we will try another mechanism, for now choose the default N If you had chosen y in this option you will get this sub option. Is this your personal page (username.github.io)? (y/N) Choose y , After this we will get this message in either case. Done. Your new project is available at /home/username/myWork/mySampleBlog Our blogs boilerplate is available. Here is the folder structure. We have still not seen how the blog will look like, we will divulge into this in the next post, with all the pelican commands which is extremely important to get the full juice out of pelican.

There can be 3 option which I can think of. Direct Installation If we have only one python installation on the system, and we do not have any issue if we screw up this installation just use pip to install pelican. Installation using VirtualEnv. This approach is already mentioned in official documentation of pelican Installation using Conda. By now you could have understood that we will use Conda to install pelican. This is because Anaconda is already a prepackaged installation of very well know python package in both version 2 and 3. In future, I will update this page if I wrote about Anaconda installation, for now refer any documents on the google search for installation. Configure Anaconda for Pelican Blog The first thing we have to do is to create an environment using the python version 2. This can be done by this command. conda create -n pelican1 python=2 Once we have executed the above command we will have pelican1 as an environment. We can see the list of environment in the system by using. conda info --envs Which will provide, an output like this. pelican1 /home/username/anaconda3/envs/pelican1 py27 /home/username/anaconda3/envs/py27 py35 /home/username/anaconda3/envs/py35 root * /home/username/anaconda3 This shows all the available environment. We can activate the pelican1 by using this command. source activate pelican1 Now we have an environment which we can use for pelican development. The reason for this environment creation is to have a separate environment for experimentation with pelican, if anything goes wrong we do not disturb already existing programs. Configure Pelican Environment for Blog Once we have the environment, we have to install few packages in this environment. The first is to install PiP to install other package. Install Pip by using. conda install pip With the completion of installing pip , the first and foremost package to install is pelican, with this command. pip install pelican Since we will be using Markdown to write our blogs we need the markdown package, which we can install using. pip install Markdown There are some plugin and themes in pelican which might need some additional packages, we will install these 2. pip install Fabric pip install beautifulsoup4 Freeze the Requirement When we have all our installation complete, we should save our package history into a requirement.txt . We can use this requirement.txt to install all the above mentioned packages with same version in one go. We can freeze the details by using. pip freeze > requirements.txt Dependencies If we check the requirement.txt generated in the above step, we will see a lot of packages already installed apart from pelican , markdown , Fabric and beautifulsoup4 . These extra packages are dependencies for running pelican. feedgenerator: to generate the Atom feeds jinja2: for templating support pygments: for syntax highlighting docutils: for supporting reStructuredText as an input format pytz: for timezone definitions blinker: an object-to-object and broadcast signaling system unidecode: for ASCII transliterations of Unicode text six: for Python 2 and 3 compatibility utilities MarkupSafe: for a markup safe string implementation python-dateutil: to read the date metadata We have completed 2 important steps of our own blog publishing.

This will be the one stop place to find all the details for setting up a beginner level blog. I am a novice blogger and this blog would act as a journal, which will document my approach towards blogging, software development. The idea is to generate some revenues out of this blog in the long run. We all might have read about so many blogs which are able to generate good amount of traffic but in none one of those we have never read how do they achieve it. I may fail in my attempt, which might work as a guidance for someone to not follow this path and try another path for the same goal. The background theme to support this is to minimize my cost to the bare minimum so that the failure does not hurt me financially. Why Static Blog? There are already a lot of literature present behind this, just wanted to summarize those:- Cost:- This was the deciding factor for me, because of using a static website, this complete website can be hosted and deployed by just registering a domain name with a provider. I do not have to go for any hosting services etc. Easy of Writing Content:- I wanted to write my content using just Markdown , as i have grown comfortable writing in markdown. With using a static blog this was possible. Hosting:- We can serve these static HTML pages practically from any place, be it Github , Amazon S3 , Dropbox or any other place which can serve static HTML pages. I have chosen Github just to save the cost. Easy workflow:- The work flow is very simple when deploying with static blogs, just right you content in markdown, generate HTML, push your changes to github and that's it. Your content is not available online. You can even go crazy you cam automate the whole thing other than writing content. The above three are the main reason for choosing static blogs, but there could be many more valid reason for choosing static blogs. Most of the reason for me was personal in nature so you can also choose accordingly. Why Pelican? Once the approach to make this blog as static was finalized, the next big question came was which technology to choose, Pelican or Jekyll . There as already many comparison already available among these, but the only reason for me to choose pelican was because it uses python and jinja. In some near future I want to fully customize my blog with the knowledge of these two. Why Github? The final decision to be taken before starting this blog was to finalize the hosting provider. We have already mentioned some popular choice are Github Amazon S3 Dropbox I chose Github, for its near zero cost, it may cost you if you want to keep your repository private else it is completely free were as Amazon S3 would have required to shell out some money though less, with some extra benefits, but for the time being when I am just measuring the water it made sense to keep my cost down. Once all the above 3 moral questions were answered, setting up the blogs was easy and which will be documented in the future. Collated Blog post.
